###A Playlist Scraper for germany's shittiest radio station: NDR2
This little python script uses Beautiful Soup to scrape and print the playlist's database of NDR2. I used it for a data visualisation of german radio stations to proof that they basically share the same songs all over although they all claim to bedifferent.

__FYI:__ German radio broadcasts are as bad as german humor.
